# =================================================================== FUNCTIONS
# 1. Write a function called status_of(percent) that returns "OVER LIMIT"
#    (100% or more), "WARNING" (90% or more), or "OK" (anything else).
#
#    Typical and above: also write check(value, limit) that returns the
#    difference and the percentage as two values - do not print anything
#    inside it, only calculate and return.
#
#    Excellent: also write print_report(label, value, limit, difference,
#    percent, status) that does ALL of the printing below - nothing outside
#    it should contain a print() of its own.
#
#    Give each function a one-line docstring saying what it does.

# your function(s) go here
def status_of(percent,warning_at=90):
    """returns a string based on value input of percent (and warning_at if applied)"""
    if percent >= 100:
        return "OVER LIMIT"
    elif percent >= warning_at:
        return "WARNING"
    else:
        return "OK"

def check(value, limit):
    """Returns the difference and percentage"""
    difference = value - limit
    percent = (value / limit)*100
    return difference, percent

# ==================================================================== INPUT
# 2. Ask for your three values.
#
#    - the first is TEXT      (a name, a hostname, an IP)  -> no conversion needed
#    - the second is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())
#    - the third  is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())

label = input("Label: ")     # replace with an input() call
value = float(input("Value: "))   # replace with an input() call, converted
limit = float(input("Limit: "))  # replace with an input() call, converted


# ================================================================== PROCESS
# 3. Work out the difference, the percentage, and the status.
#
#    Threshold : call status_of() to get the status. Work out the
#                difference and percentage inline, not in a function.
#    Typical   : call check() to get the difference and percentage instead.

difference, percent = check(value, limit)   # replace with your code
percent = 0.0
status = status_of(percent)          # replace with your code


# =================================================================== OUTPUT
# 4. Print the report.
#
#    Threshold : the three values you were given, plus status, inside a border
#    Typical   : add difference and percent, 2 decimal places, right-aligned
#    Excellent : call print_report() instead of printing directly here, and
#                wrap sections 2-4 in a loop so you can check as many records
#                as you like in one run - type "quit" as the label to stop.
#                Keep count of how many came back OVER LIMIT and print that
#                once, after the loop ends.

print()
print("=" * 34)
print(f"  RECORD CHECK  -  {label}")
print("=" * 34)
print(f"Value: {value:>5.2f}")
print(f"Limit: {limit:>5.2f}")
print(f"Difference: {difference:>5.2f}")
print(f"Percent: {percent:>5.2f}%")
print(f"Status: {status}")
# your report lines go here

print("=" * 34)


# ==========================================================================
# 5. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it three times with different numbers
#    [ ] Run it with a total of 0 and note the error (do not fix it yet)
#    [ ] Check every function does one job - if a function both calculates
#        and prints, split it
